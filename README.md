description:
In this exercise, I exercised the minishell by a father and son and a command line wanted by the father and son in charge of executing the command. Each step in the loop has an input check to see if such a command exists. :
A program that receives a list of words with spaces up to 510 characters from the user, sends a function that breaks down the words by the spaces and then inserts a 2D array, then the program sends the resulting array to the function that prints it, and then has a function that frees all assignments..


input:
string


output:   strings
